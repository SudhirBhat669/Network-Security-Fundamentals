## Network Security Fundamentals: Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding core network security fundamentals by exploring how Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) protect enterprise networks from cyber threats.
As a intern, this project helped me bridge the gap between theoretical networking concepts and real-world SOC and enterprise security environments.

##  Objectives
- Understand the role of firewalls in network security
- Learn how IDS detects malicious traffic
- Understand how IPS actively blocks threats
- Visualize enterprise network security architecture
- Map security tools to SOC workflows

## Key Concepts Covered
- Network Firewalls (Packet Filtering, Stateful, NGFW)
- IDS vs IPS (Detection vs Prevention)
- Network-based IDS (NIDS)
- Host-based IDS (HIDS)
- Defense-in-Depth strategy
- SOC alerting and escalation flow

## Tools & Technologies
- Networking Fundamentals (TCP/IP)
- Firewall Concepts
- IDS / IPS Architecture
- Diagram-based explanation

## Outcomes
- Strong foundational understanding of enterprise network security
- Ability to explain firewall and IDS/IPS workflows in interviews
- Improved SOC-level thinking and defensive mindset
- Hands-on experience documenting security architectures
